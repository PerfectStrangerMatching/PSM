#Perfect-Stranger-Matching

This repository contains perfect stranger matching tables for all configurations up to 40 participants. For a configuration with n participants and group size g, the respective file is named "g"to"n". For example "2to40" referrs to the configuration (n,g)=(40,2). Each row within those files contains one group allocation within a sequence of group allocations. Thereby each participant has an unique fixed participant number, e.g. for 6 participants the numbers 1-6 are used as identifier. Thus, participants are assigned to groups, indicated by the brackets "[...,...]", while multiple of those groups make up a whole group allocation (in one row).

Furthermore supplemntary material is provided in the Online-Appendix
